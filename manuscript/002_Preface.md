# Preface

For Tampere Goes Agile 2014 conference I organized, I invited Woody Zuill to deliver a keynote: Mob Programming. Whole Team Approach. I remember sitting in the audience, thinking that what he was describing was interesting but that it *would not work where I worked*.

With a few years and experiences in the software industry behind me, I've learned to recognize the triggers that often lead to new insights. Resisting without having tried something is one of the major triggers.

I went back to office, and started working to convince my team to try it with me. Eventually I learned that them caring about my happiness was what allowed them to risk wasting a few hours. But it wasn't a waste, it was an enjoyable lesson of learning together about our codebase through refactoring.

We continued mob programming as a way of learning, having a session every two weeks. Mob programming became our gateway to pairing and improved collaboration in general. What I thought was a waste of time, turned out to be a time saver. What I thought was something I would never enjoy, turned out to be something that reminded me that I have been a programmer since age of 13.

Since that team, I have used mob programming as a way of consulting and teaching, having now perspectives to the difference people say they know and what they can do being put on the work. Mob programming - and mob testing - have become invaluable for growing the next generations of professionals as well as keeping the current generations continuously learning.

I still face resistance to mob programming from senior developers who get the job done alone. They learned their way, reading books and articles and writing and delivering code. They don't find their motivation for mob programming in learning, but enabling learning of others. 

## Growing Your Wizard

Teams have people with different skills areas and levels. Your team may have high level the warriors, who get through every battle alive. But your team may also have low level wizard, who will die in battle without their team protecting them, allowing them to collect the experience for leveling up.

We don't work only to do the work of today. We build the abilities to do the work of tomorrow. The low level wizard of today is the high level wizard of the future, who will cast a spell from the back row making your battles painless. But you need to support them while they get there, exposing them safely to the experience.

And even the most seasoned warriors amongst us have more to learn. Not only from other seasoned ones, but perspectives that enable us to work smart instead of hard.

In programming, we find the work we need to do as we do the work and our assumptions unfold into realities. Getting the best out of everyone into the work we are doing is worthwhile, enables learning and streamlines the results.
