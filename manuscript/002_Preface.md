# Preface

For Tampere Goes Agile 2014 conference I organized, I invited Woody Zuill to deliver a keynote: Mob Programming. Whole Team Approach. I remember sitting in the audience, thinking that what he was describing was interesting but that it *would not work where I worked*.

With a few years and experiences in the software industry behind me, I've learned to recognize the triggers that often lead to new insights. Resisting without having tried something is one of the major triggers.

I went back to office, and started working to convince my team to try it with me. Eventually I learned that them caring about my happiness was what allowed them to risk wasting a few hours. But it wasn't a waste, it was an enjoyable lesson of learning together about our codebase through refactoring.

We continued mob programming as a way of learning, having a session every two weeks. Mob programming became our gateway to pairing and improved collaboration in general. What I thought was a waste of time, turned out to be a time saver. What I thought was something I would never enjoy, turned out to be something that reminded me that I have been a programmer since age of 13.

Since that team, I have used mob programming as a way of consulting and teaching, having now perspectives to the difference people say they know and what they can do being put on the work. Mob programming - and mob testing - have become invaluable for growing the next generations of professionals as well as keeping the current generations continuously learning.

I still face resistance to mob programming from senior developers who get the job done alone. They learned their way, reading books and articles and writing and delivering code. They don't find their motivation for mob programming in learning, but enabling learning of others.

Enjoy mob programming guidebook. Try mobbing out and make it your own. This book is just for you to get started. We are all still discovering ways to turn up the good.
