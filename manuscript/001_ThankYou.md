**To the person reading this book in progress,**

Thank you. For considering mob programming as something of interest. For considering my ideas and experiences as something that could help you on your path. For reading this book.

I write on LeanPub so that I can make text available to you before it is all completed and finished. The work of learning and teaching Mob Programming is far from done. LeanPub enables me to create a place to collect bits of that knowledge with the goal of the guidebook: condensing information you will need to get started on a good foot with your Mob Programming journey.

I would love to hear from you. What questions you have, what lessons have been useful? Creating a book takes a lot of persistence, and for authors like myself, a sense of community. Every time I see an email saying someone purchased the book, I cannot thank you enough for the motivational boost.
